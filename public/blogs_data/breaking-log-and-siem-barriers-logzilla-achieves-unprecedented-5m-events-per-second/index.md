Imagine if the flow of data in your network could move faster than the speed of thought - what would you do with that power? In Network and CyberSecurity, where the velocity of log processing is the backbone of IT operations, LogZilla has not just improved the standard, we've revolutionized it. 

Achieving an unparalleled 5 million events per second, LogZilla turns the impossible into reality, redefining the limits of log management and setting a new benchmark for the industry. This isn't just a step forward; it’s a giant leap for log management technology.

## The Breakthrough

Have you ever wondered what it would be like if your Centralized Log Management / SIEM tool could keep pace with growth of data? LogZilla has turned that wonder into reality. The milestone we’ve hit isn’t just a bigger number - it’s a seismic shift in how data is processed, delivering insights at speeds we’ve only dreamed of before. This leap to 5 million events per second reimagines the potential of log management, merging speed with efficiency in a way that transforms data into decisions faster than ever.

Facing the Herculean task of managing vast seas of data, the world's largest companies like tech giants, major retailers, and industry leaders such as Apple, Tesla, Cisco, Wal-Mart and others navigate a daily deluge of logs, often scaling to multiple terabytes that necessitate sprawling across hundreds or even thousands of servers. LogZilla has crafted a solution that not only tackles this deluge but does so with an architectural marvel that stands unmatched. With LogZilla's breakthrough, this data - enough to overwhelm the sturdiest of systems - is now processed at a staggering rate of 5 million events per second on a mere 25 nodes of basic "commodity" type of compute. Our test results seen in the EPS chart here were run on 25 nodes equipped with just 8GB RAM and 8 vCores at a mere $200/mo cost. 

This isn't just about doing more with less; it's about redefining the economics of IT operations. LogZilla's evolutionary step in processing means raw data is now swiftly carved into actionable intelligence, providing speed that propels businesses forward while simultaneously offering a dramatic downturn in operational costs – a multimillion-dollar pivot that will redefine budget allocations across the sector.

It's a system built with foresight, embodying principles of modularity, high concurrency, and intelligent resource management, ensuring that it can scale effortlessly and maintain performance even under the strain of massive event streams.

Unlike anything before, this system has turned the efficiency paradigm on its head. Where once log and SIEM tools were a critical bottleneck, they are now a conduit, channeling the flow of trillions of events with the finesse of a precision instrument. LogZilla's new architecture does more than process data at remarkable speeds; it redefines the ecosystem of event management by making such speeds the new normal, setting a bar where others in the field will aspire to reach.

This transformative capability didn’t arise overnight. It is the product of visionary engineering, exhaustive testing, and a bold ambition to lead the market not by steps but by bounds. The architecture's design allows for a unique blend of deduplication, normalization, and real-time event correlation, working in concert to turn voluminous data into succinct, relevant insights.

What stands out is not just the ability to process data at these speeds but to do so with an infrastructure that is not prohibitively expensive or complex. LogZilla’s breakthrough presents an elegant solution that delivers performance traditionally reserved for multi-million dollar, high-end, enterprise-grade systems, yet is attainable and practical for a broad spectrum of users.

As organizations struggle with the cost of ingesting extremely large datasets, LogZilla offers a beacon of capability, clarity, and control. This is not simply an advancement in technology; it is a reimagining of possibilities, a reengineering of expectations, and a redefinition of what it means to be at the forefront of log management innovation.

## Behind the Scenes

As the saying goes, "First they'll say it's impossible, then they'll say it was inevitable." At LogZilla, challenging what seems impossible has been part of our DNA from the start. Twelve years ago, our goal was to process 1 million events per second—a benchmark then considered out of reach. We achieved that goal years ago, proving that with the right approach, ambitious targets are attainable.

Today, we've raised the bar again, achieving 5 million events per second using just 25 commodity nodes. This breakthrough illustrates not just a quantitative increase but a significant improvement in efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Our technology now operates at a small fraction of the cost compared to traditional systems, enhancing scalability and accessibility for our users.

As we continue at LogZilla, our focus remains on delivering robust, efficient solutions. Innovation here is about practical advancements that drive real value for our users.
