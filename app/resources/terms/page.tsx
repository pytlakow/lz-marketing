            The Service is a website that: (a) provides information regarding LogZilla and LogZilla’s proprietary software; and (b) facilitates the purchase of licenses and access to LogZilla software. Your use of LogZilla software is subject to additional terms and conditions which you will have an opportunity to review and accept prior to downloading or otherwise accessing LogZilla software, currently: End User License Agreement.

        </p>
        <p className="text-2xl my-2">Accounts and Registration</p>
        <p>
            To access some features of the Service, you may be required to register for an account. When you register for an account, you may be required to provide us with some information about yourself, such as your email address or other contact information. You agree that the information you provide to us is accurate and that you will keep it accurate and up-to-date at all times. When you register, you will be asked to provide a password. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account and password, and you accept responsibility for all activities that occur under your account.

        </p>
        <p className="text-2xl my-2">Payment</p>
        <p>
            The Service may enable you to perform purchase transactions for licenses to LogZilla software. Before you pay any fees, you will have an opportunity to review and accept the fees that you will be charged. LogZilla uses a third party payment processor to collect this payment and unless otherwise agreed, LogZilla accepts payment for purchase transactions via credit card. Fees are due immediately upon placement of an order through the Service. By placing an order, you authorize LogZilla to provide your payment details to its third party payment processor for processing and to charge all sums you specify at the time of purchase, to the payment method you specify at the time of purchase. If you pay any fees with a credit card, LogZilla or its third party payment processor may seek pre-authorization of your credit card account prior to your purchase to verify that the credit card is valid and has the necessary funds or credit available to cover your purchase. The Service may include functionality for activating, updating or canceling recurring payments for periodic charges. If you activate or update recurring payments through the Service, you authorize LogZilla or its third party payment processor to periodically charge, on a going-forward basis and until cancellation of either the recurring payments or your account, all accrued sums on or before the payment due date for the accrued sums. If you use the Service to update or cancel any existing authorized one-time or recurring payment, it may take up to 30 business days for the update or cancellation to take effect.
